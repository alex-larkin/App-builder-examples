# App-builder-examples
See examples of how to create apps with Reading App Builder (RAB) or Scripture App Builder (SAB). You can download these app builders at:

These files utilize USFM- Unified Style Format Markers. You can look them up at 
   - https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/genindex.html
   - https://markups.paratext.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/usfm-docs_3.0.1.zip (PDF for offline use)
        - For offline use, I also recommend downloading https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/genindex.html as an HTML file to help you look up a specific marker and find its section, as in the PDF it is not possible to search by markers.
